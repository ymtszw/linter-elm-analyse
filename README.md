# linter-elm-analyse

Lint your Elm code with [elm-analyse] in Atom Editor. Still very early in development.

[elm-analyse]: https://github.com/stil4m/elm-analyse

Depends on:

- [elm-analyse]
- [Linter](https://github.com/steelbrain/linter)

Currently no configuration. `elm-analyse` must be installed globally.

Working directory is always current project root.
Both `elm-package.json` and `elm-analyse.json` must be found there.
