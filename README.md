Lint your Elm code with [elm-analyse] in Atom Editor. Still very early in development.

Currently no configuration. Lints on change saved. `elm-analyse` must be installed globally.

Working directory is always current project root.
Both `elm-package.json` and `elm-analyse.json` must be found there.

Depends on:
